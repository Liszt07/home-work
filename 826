To understand this point, one must first understand a common sense, that is, the ancient people did not stand facing north like the compass we commonly use today, with the direction determined by up, north, down, south, left, west, right, and east. Instead, they stood facing south, following the direction of left, blue, dragon, right, white, tiger, front, vermilion, sparrow, and rear, Xuanwu. Qinglong Dongfang is located on the left side of ancient people and on the right side of modern people, but with different habits, they both refer to the same direction. In Feng Shui, Feng Shui inherits the usage of ancient people, where the left side is represented by a green dragon and the right side is represented by a white tiger, and the position of the cave is divided into left and right, not referring to determining the direction in daily life. This is also a difference. Divided by the location of the acupoints, it is always left, green dragon, right, white tiger, front, red sparrow, and back, mysterious martial arts. People who do not understand feng shui cannot distinguish the difference between feng shui orientation and reality, and are prone to confusion.
