Today, we learned about product related knowledge and understood how products go from abstract requirements to concrete things step by step. At the same time, we delved into the design ideas of products through several questions. My classmates' book sharing has also given me a better understanding of code and product design. The internal discussions within the team have clarified the arrangement of class tasks and the distribution of dividends and cooperation among members.
